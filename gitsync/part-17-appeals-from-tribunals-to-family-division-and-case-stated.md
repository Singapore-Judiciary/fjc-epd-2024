(1) Part 20, Rule 3(4) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 states that the supporting affidavit must include the record of proceedings if that is available and is necessary for the appeal or the application. If the record of proceedings is necessary for the appeal or the application, and is not available at the time when the supporting affidavit is filed but subsequently becomes available, the appellant or applicant should seek permission from the Court to file a further affidavit to include the record of proceedings when it becomes available. To facilitate this, the appellant or applicant should promptly apply for any written grounds of decision, the record of evidence or notes of arguments taken in respect of the proceedings before the tribunal.
