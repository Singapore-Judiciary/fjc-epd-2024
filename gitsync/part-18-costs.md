## 150. Definitions

Where the words and phrases set out in Part 22, Rule 1(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 are used in this Part, they shall have the same meaning as defined in Part 22, Rule 1(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, unless otherwise specified.

## 151. Basis of assessment

Every bill of costs to be assessed pursuant to a judgment or order of Court must be filed together with a copy of the judgment or order of Court. Where an order for assessment is not required under the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, the bill of costs shall describe succinctly in its heading the basis of assessment. A bill of costs for assessment between a solicitor and his or her client pursuant to section 120(3) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 must be filed together with a copy of the document signifying the consent of the parties to assessment.

## 152. Form of bill of costs

## 153. Electronic filing of bills of costs for assessment

(1) Each bill of costs submitted to the Court through the Electronic Filing Service must:

> (a) be in Portable Document Format (PDF);
>
> (b) comply with paragraph 152 of these Practice Directions; and
>
> (c) be accompanied by a bill of costs summary, the electronic form of which will be composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. The information required by the Electronic Filing Service to compose the bill of costs summary includes the costs claimed under sections 1, 2 and 3 of the bill of costs.

(2) As the Registrar’s certificate of costs under Part 22, Rule 28 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 will be composed online based on the summary in sub-paragraph 1(c), solicitors should ensure that the information contained in the summary accurately reflects the information contained in the bill of costs submitted. Solicitors should also ensure that the amounts claimed for GST in the summary are correct.

(3) There is no necessity for solicitors to collect the assessed bill of costs from the Registry to prepare the Registrar’s certificate. The procedure for preparation of draft orders in paragraph 142 of these Practice Directions will, with the necessary modifications, apply to the preparation of the Registrar’s certificate.

(4) The Registrar’s certificate must be composed online through the Electronic Filing Service.

## 154. Objections

(1) Any objections in principle or as to quantum of the items claimed in a bill of costs must be indicated by the filing and service of a Notice of Dispute on Bill of Costs in Form 143 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions at least 7 days before the date fixed by the Registrar for the assessment of the bill of costs.

(2) The Notice of Dispute on Bill of Costs must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service in PDF and be accompanied by a Notice of Dispute summary, the electronic form of which will be composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. The information required by the Electronic Filing Service to compose the Notice of Dispute summary includes the amounts of costs to be awarded under sections 1, 2 and 3 of the bill of costs according to the paying party.

## 155. Amount allowed as disbursements on account of use of Electronic Filing Service

(1) If a document is filed using the Electronic Filing Service, $0.40 for each page of the document filed must be allowed as costs between parties to proceedings. Such costs may be claimed by a receiving party from the paying party where the receiving party is entitled to costs for the filing of the document. These costs must be allowed in addition to all other disbursements and Court fees.

(2) This paragraph applies to the assessment of costs as well as cases where the Court fixes a gross sum of costs instead of directing an assessment.

(3) This paragraph does not apply to any document filed through the service bureau.

## 156. Assessments involving the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid

(1) The directions contained in this paragraph must be followed in respect of all assessments in which the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid is involved.

(2) For all assessments in which the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid is involved:

> (a) the receiving party must, prior to the filing of the bill of costs in Court through the Electronic Filing Service, send the bill of costs to be filed to the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid, as the case may be;
>
> (b) the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid, as the case may be, should then inform the receiving party whether he or she agrees or disagrees with the amounts claimed in the bill of costs; and
>
> (c) when filing the bill of costs in Court through the Electronic Filing Service, the receiving party must state whether the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid, as the case may be, disagrees with the amounts claimed in the bill of costs. The bill of costs should also be served on the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid, as may be applicable, on the same day that the bill of costs is filed.

(3) If the Public Trustee or the Director of Legal Aid, as the case may be, agrees with the amounts claimed in the bill of costs, then:

> (a) for solicitor-and-client bills filed pursuant to the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 where the Director of Legal Aid is the respondent, the receiving party and the Director of Legal Aid need not attend at the assessment and the bill will be assessed in their absence. However, if the Registrar disagrees with the quantum of costs agreed on, he or she may nonetheless direct the attendance of the Director of Legal Aid and the receiving party, at a later date.

## 157. Fixing costs instead of ordering assessment

(1) Part 22, Rule 2(3) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 provides that:

**Powers of Court (P. 22, r. 2)**

…

(3) Subject to the provisions of this Part and any written law, the costs payable by any party to any other party in any matter must be fixed by the Court which heard the matter after an oral hearing or by way of written submissions from the parties, unless the Court thinks fit to direct an assessment of the costs.

Solicitors should therefore be prepared to make submissions on the entitlement to and quantum of costs at the end of a hearing or trial, whether before or after judgment is delivered.

(2) Solicitors should note that the Court may fix costs where costs have been ordered to be in the cause, or on hearing applications for dismissal or striking out pursuant to an unless order, and be prepared to make submissions accordingly.
