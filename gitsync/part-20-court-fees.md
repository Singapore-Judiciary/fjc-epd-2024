## 165. Definitions of this Part

Where the words and phrases defined in Part 25, Rule 1 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 are used in this Part, they shall have the same meaning as defined in Part 25, Rule 1 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, unless otherwise specified.

## 166. Request for waiver or deferment of court fees in Family Division

A request for the waiver or deferment of the whole or any part of any appeal court fees under Part 25, Rule 3 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 must be supported by an affidavit in Form 145 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions. The affidavit in Form 145 must verify Form 146 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

## 167. Electronic payment of court fees

_**Implementation of electronic means for payment of court fees**_

(1) Subject to these Practice Directions, all court fees not paid using the Electronic Filing Service may be paid by electronic means.

_**Modes of payment by electronic means**_

(2) Payment by electronic means includes payment effected by Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS and selected credit cards. For law firms with standing GIRO arrangements with the Family Justice Courts, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment where court fees are paid over the counter. A law firm using IBG for such purposes will authorise the Family Justice Courts to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed form.

_**Scope of payment by electronic means**_

(3) The electronic means of payment cover all court fees previously collected over the counter and hearing fees in the Family Justice Courts.

_**Registrar’s discretion**_

(4) Unless otherwise approved by the Registrar, payment of court fees collected over the counter must be made by electronic means. The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirement for the payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as the Registrar deems fit.

## 168. Stamping of documents

(1) Only documents filed in the Family Justice Courts will be stamped at the Family Justice Courts’ stamp office. The amount of stamp fees payable must be indicated on the top right hand corner of the document. In addition, solicitor’s employees or solicitors must complete and submit the requisition form set out in Form 132 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions, together with the relevant document(s) to the cashier for stamping.

(2) Payment should be made with NETS, PayNow, Cash, local Cashier’s Order and Bank Draft (in Singapore currency). Cashier’s Orders and Bank Drafts should be crossed and made payable to:

“Registrar, Supreme Court/AG”
