## **21B: Electronic Filing under the IELS**

## 170. Proceedings for which the IELS is to be used

Pursuant to Part 28, Rules 3 and 6 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, the Registrar hereby specifies that the IELS is to be used for all civil proceedings in the Family Justice Courts (including appeals from quasi-criminal proceedings) and all documents to be filed with, served on, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the Registrar in such proceedings must be so filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed using the IELS.

## 171. Establishment of Electronic Filing Service and appointment of electronic filing service provider

In exercise of the powers conferred by Part 28, Rules 3 and 4 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, the Registrar, with the approval of the Chief Justice, has established an Electronic Filing Service known as the Integrated Electronic Litigation System or eLitigation and accessible at [https://www.elitigation.sg](https://www.elitigation.sg) and has appointed CrimsonLogic Pte Ltd as the Electronic Filing Service provider.

## 172. Appointment of agent to establish service bureau

Pursuant to Part 28, Rule 13 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, the Registrar has appointed CrimsonLogic Pte Ltd as an agent to establish a service bureau or service bureaux at such address or addresses in Singapore as may be deemed suitable.

## 173. Registered user and authorised user

(2) For the purposes of Part 28, Rule 14(1) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, an application to the Registrar to be a registered user is to be made using Form 151 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions. For the purposes of Part 28, Rule 14(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, a registered user may designate one or more authorised users by nominating at least 1 authorised user in Form 151 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

## 174. Certificate of Service

Where documents are served using the IELS, a Certificate of Service will automatically be generated and stored in the electronic case file.

## 175. Form of documents

(1) Unless otherwise provided for in these Practice Directions or directed by the Court, it is not necessary for documents that are electronically filed in Court to have a cover page or backing sheet.

(2) Parties are reminded that they must, at all times, ensure that the information stored in the frontend system is up-to-date and free from errors as the same information will be reproduced in electronic forms that are generated by the IELS. Documents generated by the IELS containing outdated or wrong information will be rejected by the Registry and the fee payable is stipulated in the Third Schedule to the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.

(3) In the event that the IELS fails to automatically generate the document information page, parties may undertake the procedure outlined in paragraph 181(2) of these Practice Directions.

## 176. Pagination of documents

Every single page of a document must be paginated so that the pagination on the actual document corresponds with the pagination of the Portable Document Format (PDF) document in the electronic case file. The attention of solicitors is drawn to paragraphs 133(6) and 136(3) in this regard. This is to facilitate hearings involving reference to both hard and soft copies of the same document.

## 177. Filing documents through service bureau

(1) Solicitors and law firms are encouraged to file documents through the IELS. However, in the event that certain documents cannot be filed through the IELS, solicitors and law firms may file documents through the service bureau. A party who is not legally represented may also file documents through the service bureau.

(2) The operating hours of the service bureau may be found on the IELS website at [https://www.elitigation.sg](https://www.elitigation.sg).

(3) Documents to be filed through the service bureau must comply with these Practice Directions and all applicable administrative instructions and procedures prescribed by the service bureau with the approval of the superintendent.

## 178. Filing of documents to the Family Justice Courts through another service bureau

Pursuant to Part 28, Rule 19(4) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, the Registrar hereby prescribes that any service bureau established or authorised to be established by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or the Registrar of the State Courts may be used to assist in the filing, service, delivery or conveyance of documents pertaining to Family Justice Courts proceedings using the IELS in all cases and circumstances where the staff of that service bureau are able to provide such assistance.

## 179. Limits on the size and number of documents submitted using the IELS

(1) The following limits currently apply to the filing of documents using the IELS:

> (a) The total number of documents in a single submission cannot exceed 99.
>
> (b) The total number of pages in a single document cannot exceed 9,999.
>
> (c) The size of a single transmission cannot exceed 500 mega-bytes.

(2) The limits described in sub-paragraph (1) will apply to filing online through both the IELS and the service bureau.

(3) The resolution for scanning of documents, unless otherwise directed by the Court, must be no more than 300 DPI.

(4) In the event that any solicitor wishes to file documents which exceed the limits specified in sub-paragraph (1), he or she should inform the Registrar at least 14 days before the intended filing date. The solicitor will then be asked to attend before the Registrar for directions on how the documents should be filed.

## 180. Documents which cannot be converted into an electronic format

(1) If a document cannot be converted in whole or in part into an electronic format for any reason, the hard copy of the document must be filed at the Registry.

(2) If the Court receives a document which the filing party says cannot be converted in whole or in part into an electronic format, and it can discern no good reason why the document cannot be converted into an electronic format, the document may be rejected.

## 181. Rejection of documents, back-dating and refund of penalty

(1) Care must be taken to enter correct, complete and accurate information into the electronic form. If the information entered into the electronic form and the actual document differ, the document is likely to be rejected by the Court. If a document is rejected by the Court for any reason, a penalty may nonetheless be payable in respect of the document, as specified in the Third Schedule of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. In this regard, the attention of solicitors is also drawn to Part 28, Rule 12 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.

(2) In the event that any document is rejected through no fault of the filing party, a solicitor may:

> (a) re-file the document with a request that the date and time of filing or issuance, as the case may be, be back-dated to an earlier date and time, pursuant to Part 28, Rule 8(4) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024; and
>
> (b) request a refund by submitting the requisite electronic form through the IELS.

(3) Where permission of Court has been obtained to expunge parts of a document or affidavit from the Court record, an applicant or his or her solicitor must re-file the document or affidavit with the expunged parts redacted.

(4) To avoid doubt, a filing fee will be payable in respect of the re-filed document or affidavit as specified in the Third Schedule to the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 and the filing fee paid on the earlier filing of that document or affidavit will not be refunded.

## 182. Hard copies of documents

(1) The Registrar may, in the Registrar’s discretion, request hard copies of any documents filed electronically.

(2) Upon such request, the filing party or that party’s solicitors must furnish hard copies of the relevant documents at the venue specified by the Registrar:

> (a) within the specified time frame; or
>
> (b) within 24 hours of the request, if no time frame is specified.

(3) The Registrar may also direct that any documents are to be filed in hard copy instead of using the IELS for such period or periods as the Registrar thinks fit.

## 183. Responsibility for accuracy and completeness of information submitted using the IELS

(1) The solicitor having the conduct of any cause or matter may delegate the task of filing originating processes and documents in Court to an assistant or a suitably experienced solicitor’s employee or secretary, provided always that the solicitor is to personally satisfy himself or herself as to the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted to the Court, and will personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.

(2) In particular, solicitors should ensure the following:

> (a) that the title of the action generated using the IELS is accurate and correct;
>
> (b) where an action is commenced by way of an originating application, that either the relevant legislation under which the action is brought is provided or at least 1 nature of claim is selected that adequately represents the subject matter of the action; and
>
> (c) where a document submitted is a digitally verifiable document issued by the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore (e.g. a Digital Death Certificate or Digital Death Extract or a Digital Birth Certificate) or an electronic grant of probate or letters of administration issued by a foreign court, that its authenticity has been verified.

_**Consolidated or transferred cases in civil proceedings**_

(3) Where permission of Court has been obtained to consolidate cases or transfer a case from the Supreme Court to the Family Justice Courts, the applicant or his or her solicitor must inform the Registry of the order for consolidation or transfer by way of an “Other Hearing Related Request” through the IELS.
