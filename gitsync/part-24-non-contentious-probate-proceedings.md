## 207. Application of this Part

(1) The directions in this Part apply to applications filed under Part 6 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024.

(2) Where the words and phrases defined in Part 6, Rule 1 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024 are used in this Part, they have the same meaning as defined in Part 6, Rule 1 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024, unless otherwise specified.

## 208. Applications for grant of probate or letters of administration or resealing

_**Filing of originating application and supporting documents**_

(1) An application for:

> (a) a grant of probate or letters of administration made under Part 6, Rule 3 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024; or
>
> (b) resealing made under Part 6, Rule 46 of Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024,
>
> must be made by originating application without notice in Form 162 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions with a certified true copy of the will or foreign grant, if any, and other supporting papers.

(2) Prior to filing the originating application, the applicant may conduct a litigation search in the record of caveats and the record of probate applications to ascertain if there are any caveats or previous probate applications in respect of the estate and to consider whether to proceed with the filing.

(3) For deaths occurring before 15 December 2003, the applicant must state in the originating application, whether to the best of the applicant’s knowledge, there are any caveats or probate applications in respect of the deceased’s estate. The applicant is not required to state the position with respect to caveats and probate applications for deaths occurring on or after 15 December 2003.

(4) The originating application must be submitted by entering the relevant information in the appropriate electronic form. The following documents are to be submitted at the same time as the originating application:

> (a) where the deceased has been issued a digitally verifiable document by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, Singapore (e.g. a Digital Death Certificate or Digital Death Extract) (referred to in this Part collectively as a “Digital Death Certificate”), a copy of the Digital Death Certificate (unless the Electronic Filing Service indicates that a copy of the Digital Death Certificate is not required to be filed);
>
> (b) where a Digital Death Certificate is not available, a certified true copy of the death certificate of the deceased or a certified true copy of the order of Court for presumption of death of the deceased;
>
> (c) where there is an original will (and / or codicil(s)), a certified true copy that is certified on every page. If there is insufficient space on any page to affix the certified true copy stamp that is normally used, such page(s) can be scanned to include a margin or space (on A4-equivalent softcopy) by scanning at a reduction ratio that is no less than 90%. If this is also not possible, the solicitor may file a copy of the will (and codicil(s), where applicable) with a cover page containing a certification that “This is a certified true copy of the will (and / or codicil(s)) of \[name of deceased] dated \[date], pages \[X] to \[Y].” provided that a request is made to the Registry, explaining why certification on every page is not possible, and such a request is approved by the Registry;
>
> (d) where the applicant is making an application under section 9 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934 for probate of a copy of the will, the certified true copy of the will is to contain the certification “This is a certified true copy of the will of \[name of deceased] dated \[date] admitted to proof pursuant to an order of court dated \[date of order] in \[case number in which the order was given].” on a covering page that is to be attached to the certified copy of the will;
>
> (e) if the applicant requires a clean copy of the original will to be engrossed for any purpose, the applicant may file a request to engross a clean copy of the will to be annexed to the extracted grant and state the reasons for the request;
>
> (f) in the case of a resealing of a foreign grant, a copy of the original sealed foreign grant or a sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant issued by the foreign court or authority;
>
> (g) where the foreign grant is issued by the foreign court or authority in an electronic format, the digitally verifiable sealed foreign grant downloaded from the website of the foreign court or authority with the certification by a solicitor on a covering page that is to be attached to the foreign grant stating “The undersigned has verified that this document is the electronic sealed foreign grant downloaded from \[state the website of the foreign court or authority] and the authenticity of this document.”;
>
> (h) in the case of an estate of a Muslim person who died domiciled in Singapore, a certified true copy of the inheritance certificate issued by the Syariah Court;
>
> (i) in relation to deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008, a Schedule of Assets listing the property comprising the estate of the deceased in accordance with paragraph 212 of these Practice Directions (if available); and
>
> (j) any other documents in support of the originating application required under the Probate and Administration Act 1934 or the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024.

(5) The administration oath under section 28 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934 may be filed at the same time as the supporting affidavit under Part 6, Rule 3 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024 as required by paragraph 209.

(6) Where applicable, solicitors are to indicate through the Electronic Filing Service that they have verified the authenticity of the digitally verifiable document issued by the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore (e.g. a Digital Death Certificate).

(7) An electronic filing checklist will be generated and a provisional reference number will be issued when the originating application and supporting documents are filed. The electronic filing checklist will indicate the status of the documents filed. It will be the means by which the Court indicates whether any other documents or further action is required on the part of the applicant. The provisional reference number allows for the easy referencing and monitoring of the electronic filing checklist during the initial phase of filing.

(8) The original will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant (if any) must be submitted to the Probate Counter by 4.30 p.m. of the next operating day of the Probate Counter after the filing of the originating application for verification. Where the original will has been retained in the custody of a foreign court or authority, a certified true copy of the will by that foreign court or authority must be filed and submitted for verification in place of the original. Where the foreign grant is issued by the foreign court or authority in an electronic format, the applicant or his or her solicitor is to satisfy the Probate Counter on an electronic device that the document in the court file is the digitally verifiable sealed foreign grant downloaded from website of the foreign court or authority.

(9) The Probate Counter will return the original will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant to the applicant after verifying that the copy of the document in the court file is an exact copy of the original document submitted.

(10) When the Court is satisfied that the originating application and the supporting documents have been properly filed and verified, a probate number will be issued in place of the provisional reference number. This probate number will be tied to the same electronic filing checklist.

(11) In the originating application without notice, the applicant is to specify where required:
