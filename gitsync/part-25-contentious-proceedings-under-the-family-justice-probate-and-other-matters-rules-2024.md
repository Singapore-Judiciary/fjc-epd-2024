## 222. Documents to be filed for case conferences

_**Pre-Case Conference Questionnaire**_

(1) The Pre-Case Conference Questionnaire (“PCQ”) is intended to facilitate the Court’s discussion with parties at the case conferences on the various issues, timelines and milestones for each case. Solicitors or parties who are not legally represented should familiarise themselves with the PCQ and be ready to address the Court on the issues relevant to the parties’ respective cases.

(2) Unless the Court otherwise directs, each party must file the PCQ in the manner and form set out in Form 179 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions, to the extent possible, 1 week before the first RCC. Parties are to confer and discuss the matters in the PCQ, including agreed positions (if any) before filing the PCQ.

(3) Unless otherwise directed by the Court, the first RCC will be fixed:

> (a) in a case where the respondent is to be served in Singapore, 8 weeks after the originating claim or originating application is issued; or
>
> (b) in a case where an originating claim or originating application is to be served out of Singapore, 12 weeks after the originating claim or originating application is issued.

(4) At the first RCC, the PCQ will be discussed with the Registrar. The Registrar may direct parties to update or supplement parts of the PCQ at a later stage, if necessary.

_**List of Issues**_

(5) At an appropriate stage of the proceedings, the Court may direct the parties to file a List of Issues (“LOI”) which may also be included in the PCQ.

(6) The LOI is a neutral case management tool which identifies the principal issues in dispute and enables the Court and parties to determine matters such as the scope of production of documents and the scope of factual and expert evidence (if any) which should be adduced. The LOI will be continually reviewed and refined by the Court and the parties at the case conferences as the case progresses.

(7) Where both parties are not legally represented, the Court may work with the parties on the drafting of the LOI during the case conference.

_**Expert Witness Template**_

(8) Prior to the RCC where the issue of expert evidence (if any) is discussed, the parties are to fill in an Expert Witness Template in Form 180 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions.

(9) The Expert Witness Template requires the parties to provide information such as the general information pertaining to the proposed expert(s), the list of issues to be referred to the proposed expert(s), the proposed timelines for the proposed expert(s) to render his or her opinion, and the proposed duration for the expert(s)’ evidence at trial.

(10) Parties are to comply with Order 12 of the Rules of Court 2021 if they intend to adduce expert evidence for court proceedings. Parties must furnish to their intended expert witnesses, prior to any appointment, a copy of the Note to Expert Witness in Form 181 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions.

(12) In appropriate cases, the parties will be required to indicate at the RCC whether they have any objection to an order under Order 9, Rule 8(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 being made in their case.

_**Single application pending trial checklist (SAPT Checklist)**_

(13) At least 2 weeks before the date of the RCC where the issue of the filing of the SAPT will be discussed, or within such other period as the Court may direct, the Court may direct parties to complete the SAPT Checklist. A sample SAPT Checklist can be found in Form 182 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions. The SAPT Checklist is intended for parties to indicate their preferred sequence of the matters set out in the SAPT.

(14) The parties must fill in the SAPT Checklist in the following manner:

> (a) At the point of filing the SAPT, the applicant must complete columns A, B and C of the SAPT Checklist and serve it on the respondent.
>
> (b) The parties are to confer on the applicant’s proposed sequence for the matters to be heard as set out in column C of the SAPT Checklist.
>
> (c) Where the parties agree on the proposed sequence for the matters to be heard as set out in column C of the SAPT Checklist, the respondent is to indicate this in column D of the SAPT Checklist.
>
> (d) Where the respondent does not agree to the whole or any part of the applicant’s proposed sequence for the matters to be heard as set out in column C of the SAPT Checklist, the applicant is to include brief reasons for the applicant’s position, and the respondent is to set out in column D of the SAPT Checklist the respondent’s proposed sequence for the matters to be heard as well as brief reasons for the respondent’s position.

(15) The respondent must file the completed SAPT checklist at least 1 week before the date of the RCC where the issue of the filing of the SAPT will be discussed, or within such other period as the Court may direct.

(16) Directions may be given by the Court for the soft copy of the SAPT Checklist in Microsoft Word format to be sent via email to the Registry.

(17) The Court will then issue the directions on the SAPT to inform parties of the sequence of the matters to be heard for the SAPT.

## 223. Overview of amicable resolution of dispute

(1) It is the professional duty of solicitors to advise their clients to consider the amicable resolution of the dispute as well as to give their clients sufficient information about the different ways in which their disputes may be resolved using an appropriate form of amicable resolution. In this connection, the attention of solicitors is drawn to Rule 17(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015.

(2) The guidelines in Appendix D of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 on advising clients about amicable resolution of disputes apply.

(3) The amicable resolution of the dispute must be considered before the commencement and during the course of any action or appeal in order to facilitate the just, expeditious and economical disposal of cases. This is especially where amicable resolution of the dispute may save costs, achieve a quicker resolution and be a surer way of meeting the parties’ needs.

(4) To ensure that parties are in compliance with Part 5, Rules 1 and 2 of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024 and that the Court is apprised of the same, solicitors are required to state in the PCQ, in particular under Section 4 (Settlement and Amicable Resolution of Dispute Options), whether amicable resolution has been attempted and if so, when and the form of amicable resolution attempted by the parties. The PCQ is to be submitted before the first RCC.

(5) The attention of solicitors as well as all the parties is drawn to Part 16, Rule 4(c) of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024. Solicitors should advise their clients on potential adverse costs orders for any unreasonable refusal to engage in amicable resolution.

## 224. Amicable resolution offer and response to amicable resolution offer

(1) A party who wishes to attempt mediation or any other means of amicable resolution of the dispute should file and serve on all relevant parties an amicable resolution offer in Form 183 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions. The party in receipt is to respond by filing and serving the Response to Amicable Resolution Offer in Form 184 of Appendix C of these Practice Directions.

(2) If all the parties are willing to attempt amicable resolution of the dispute, directions may be given by the Court, including an adjournment of pending proceedings in Court with stipulated timelines for the completion of the amicable resolution process.

(3) If the Court orders a party to submit a sealed document setting out the party’s reasons for refusing to attempt amicable resolution pursuant to Part 5, Rule 3(3) of the Family Justice (Probate and Other Matters) Rules 2024, the party is to file the sealed document through the Electronic Filing Service into the electronic case file under “ADR Sealed Document” within 7 days after the date of the order of Court, unless the Court otherwise directs. The “ADR Sealed Document” does not need to be served on the other party or parties to the case.

(4) The “ADR Sealed Document” will be sealed upon acceptance by the Registry. Apart from the filing party, the “ADR Sealed Document” will not be available for inspection by any other party or the trial Court, until the issue of costs of the action is to be considered.

(5) Solicitors must ensure that their clients are fully informed of the option of using amicable resolution before attending the case conference. They are expected to advise their clients and to take instructions on the desirability of referring the dispute to amicable resolution.

## 225. Powers of the Court to direct mediation

(1) In any proceedings before the Court, it may direct that parties attend mediation pursuant to section 26(9) of the Family Justice Act 2014 to encourage parties to resolve the matter amicably and assist parties in reaching an agreement or to narrow the issues in contention.

In appropriate cases, a consent order may be recorded by the Judge-Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge upon the confirmation of the terms by the parties and / or their solicitors.

(5) Mediation will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. All communications made in the course of mediation will be treated in strict confidence and will not be admissible in any court unless otherwise stipulated by law.

The Registrar or the Judge may also make any orders necessary, including any orders relating to the choice of mediator (if parties are unable to agree) and pertaining to the payment for the mediation and its related fees.

(3) For mediations conducted by the Assigned Private Mediator(s), the Registrar or the Judge may give directions and timelines for parties to agree on a mediation date and to exchange case information, documents and mediation briefs.

(4) For mediations conducted by the Agreed Private Mediator, the parties or their solicitors are to inform the Registrar or the Judge of the identity of their Agreed Private Mediator, the management of the mediation and the agreed date for mediation.
