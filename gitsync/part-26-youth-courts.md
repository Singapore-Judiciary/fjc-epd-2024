## 230. Application and Appeals

_**Application**_

(1) The directions in this Part must be read in conjunction with the Criminal Procedure Code (Electronic Filing and Service for State Courts and Youth Courts) Regulations 2013.

_**Appeals**_

(2) Skeletal arguments must be filed at least 10 days before the hearing. Hard copies of the bundles of authorities and skeletal arguments shall be tendered to the Registry at the same time as they are filed.

## 231. Magistrate’s complaints (private summonses)

(1) Framing of criminal charges

Solicitors representing the complainants (save in maintenance cases) are to frame and submit the charges when the complaints are filed. This will facilitate the immediate issuance of the summons if it is so ordered by the Duty Judge.

(2) Infringement of copyright / trademarks

Magistrate’s complaints involving infringement of copyright / trademarks must be sworn by authorised representatives. A letter of authorization to that effect must be attached to the complaint.

(3) Service of summons by solicitors’ clerks

> (a) Solicitors are informed that any summons issued pursuant to Section 153 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 must be served at least 7 days before the return date of the summons if such service is undertaken by the firm’s clerk. This is because the authorization to serve will lapse 7 days before the return date.
>
> (b) If the summons is already served on the respondent 7 days before the mention date, the attached summons must be returned to the Registry immediately after service. Failure to do so will result in the summons not being listed for mention.
>
> (c) If the summons cannot be served on the respondent 1 week before the mention date, the authorization to serve will lapse. In order to obtain further authorization for the firm’s clerk to serve the summons on the respondent or to obtain an extension of the return date, the solicitor must appear before the Duty Judge not later than 5 days before the return date. Failure to comply with this may result in the complaint being struck off the list.

(4) Upon approval of an application for all other cases, and for ICMS cases where the mode of collection chosen is at the counter, the requisite number of copies of the record of proceedings applied for shall be made available for collection by the applicant for a period of 21 calendar days from the date specified in the notification given to the applicant by the Registry.

(5) Where the copy of any record of proceedings applied for is not collected by the applicant within the time given by sub-paragraph (4), the copy of the record of proceedings shall be disposed of and the applicant must make a fresh application if he or she still requires a copy of the relevant record of proceedings.

(2) The application for permission should be made as early as practicable. In addition to the need for timeliness,

> (a) where the application is for the youth to give evidence by means of a live video or live television link under section 281(5A) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, the application should state:
>
> > (i) where the youth will be giving evidence from (whether a place within a Court, a prison, an approved centre or institution in Singapore as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 or any other place in Singapore);
> >
> > (ii) the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements to be made at the place from which the youth is to make an appearance or to give evidence from; and
> >
> > (iii) the reasons for making such an application, and in particular, why it would be in the interests of justice to allow the application;
>
> (b) where the application is for a witness (not being the youth) who is not in Singapore to give evidence from a place that is not in Singapore by means of a live video or live television link, the application should also state:
>
> > (i) whether the witness is a witness specified in section 281(5B)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, and if so, the capacity of the witness (e.g, an expert witness, factual witness or otherwise);
> >
> > (ii) the administrative and technical facilities and arrangements to be made at the place from which the witness is to give evidence; and
> >

(3) The Court may, in a proper case, permit appropriate person(s) to be present with the witness (including a youth offender giving evidence as a witness, where appropriate) at the place where the witness is giving evidence from. Such person(s) may include a parent, a guardian, an officer of the Court, a counsellor, a social worker or any such other person(s) as the Court deems fit.

(4) If a youth is not represented by a solicitor, the Judge will explain to him or her the process of a witness or the youth (as the case may be) giving evidence through a video link.

(5) Microphones have been installed for the Judge, prosecutor, solicitor, witness, interpreter and the youth who are physically in Court. The oral proceedings, including the testimony of the witness, will be relayed and broadcast through the courtroom speaker system. When a video link session is in progress, prosecutors and solicitors who are physically in Court are reminded to speak clearly and slowly into the microphones which are placed on the tables. In order to ensure clarity in the audio transmissions, no two persons should speak simultaneously into the microphones.

## 244. Documents for use in criminal trials

(1) The party intending to tender a document as evidence to the Youth Courts during a trial must file an electronic copy of the document.

(2) The Court may, in its discretion, allow a party to tender a document as evidence during a trial, notwithstanding that the party has not complied with the requirements of this Part.

(4) If another party objects to the admissibility of certain documents, those documents on which agreement cannot be reached must not be electronically filed. A hard copy of those documents must be tendered at the trial.

(5) The importance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. If there are a large number of documents to be tendered, parties should submit an electronic copy of the documents stored on a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or such other storage medium acceptable to the Registrar instead of electronically filing the documents. These documents will be uploaded into the case file by the Court officer and will form part of the electronic case file.

(6) Parties may obtain directions of the Court if they are uncertain if the documents should be electronically filed, submitted on a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or such other storage medium, or tendered by hard copy.

(7) The party tendering document(s) at trial (i.e., the prosecution or defence) must provide hard copies of the document(s) at trial to the unrepresented party and to the witness.

## 244A. Application by person-in-charge of juvenile rehabilitation centre

(2) Unless the Court otherwise directs, the PIC making the application under sub-paragraph (1) must serve a Notice of Application (Form 210 of Appendix F of these Practice Directions) on the parent or guardian of the child or young person within 7 days after the date the application is made.
