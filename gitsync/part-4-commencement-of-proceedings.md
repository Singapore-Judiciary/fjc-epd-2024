## 49. Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers

_**Parties named in the title of the documents**_

(1) Where a party to any proceedings in the Family Justice Courts first files a document in such proceedings, he or she shall state his or her identification number, in parentheses, in the title of the document immediately below or after his or her name. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in the title of the documents in parentheses below or after the name of the party to which it applies.

_**Parties not named in the title of the documents**_

(2) Where a party to any proceedings in the Family Justice Courts first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, then the identification number of the party should be stated, in parentheses, below or after the first appearance of his or her name in the document. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in parentheses immediately below or after the first appearance of the name of the party to which it applies in the subsequent document.

_**Documents filed by two or more parties**_

(3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to documents which are filed by more than one party.

_**Identification numbers for non-parties**_

(4) If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is in part or in whole the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must state the identification number of such person, entity or property in parentheses immediately below or after the name of the same. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in parentheses immediately below or after the name of the person, entity or property to which it applies. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he or she may state immediately below or after the name of the same “(ID Unknown)”. All documents subsequently filed by any party shall then contain these words in parentheses below or after the name of this person, entity or property.

_**Special cases**_

(5) The following directions shall apply in addition to the directions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) to (4):

> (a) where a party is represented by a litigation representative or guardian in adoption or deputy, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representative or guardian in adoption or deputy as if he or she were party to the proceedings, and the identification numbers of the party, the litigation representative and / or guardian in adoption and / or deputy must be stated below or after the name of each, as appropriate;
>
> (b) where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he or she were a party; and
>
> (c) where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, all the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order.

_**Identification numbers**_

(6) When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number, including the letters before and after the number should be entered.

_**Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers**_

(7) The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number.

> (a) **Natural person with Singapore identity card**
>
> For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number is the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act 1965. The 7-digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example, “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”.
>
> (b) **Natural person with FIN number**
>
> For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act 1965, but has been assigned a FIN number under the Immigration Regulations, the identification number is the FIN number. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.”
>
> (c) **Natural person: birth certificate or passport number**
>
> For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act 1965 or assigned a FIN number, the identification number is the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate: “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.”
>
> (d) **Natural person: other numbers**
>
> For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and has not been assigned a FIN number and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number is the number of any identification document he or she may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.”
>
> (e) **Deceased person**
>
> For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraphs (7)(a) to (d). However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number is the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.”
>
> (f) **Company registered under the Companies Act 1967**
>
> For a company registered under the Companies Act 1967, the identification number is the Unique Entity Number (UEN).
>
> (g) **Company registered outside Singapore**
>
> For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act 1967, the identification number is the registration number of the company in the country of registration.
>
> (h) **Business registered under the Business Names Registration Act 2014**
>
> &#x20;For a body registered under the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the identification number is the UEN number.
>
> (i) **Limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005**
>
> For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, the identification number is the UEN number.
>
> (j) **Other bodies and associations**
>
> &#x20;For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraphs 7(f) to (i), the identification number is any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”.
>
> (k) **No identification numbers exist**
>
> Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by sub-paragraphs (7)(a) to (j) do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person or entity concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”.

_**Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document**_

(8) If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID No. Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party will have to furnish the necessary identification numbers to the Registry through the Electronic Filing Service.

_**Meaning of document**_

(9) To avoid doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Family Justice Courts regardless of whether they are governed by the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.

_**Non-compliance**_

(10) Any document which does not comply with this paragraph may be rejected for filing by the Registry.

## 50. Endorsements on originating processes and other documents

(1) Where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document, the directions in this paragraph apply.

(2) Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show renewal and amendments. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature as they are made pursuant to either an order of Court or the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements.

(3) For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online:

> (a) Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement, and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document.
>
> (b) Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements must be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued.
>
> (c) Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements must be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be. An example of this would be renewals of originating applications.

## 51. Distribution of applications

All applications in chambers (including originating applications and summonses) shall be filed without specifying whether the application is to be heard before a Judge or the Registrar.

## 52. Summonses

(1) A party filing a summons without notice must indicate in the summons that it is without notice. A party filing a summons “by consent” must file the consent of all other parties to the matter in the relevant form.

(2) After the filing of any summons without notice or “by consent” summons, the application will be examined by the Judge or Registrar as the case may be. If the Judge or Registrar is satisfied that the application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, the Judge or Registrar may make the order(s) applied for without the attendance of the applicant or his or her solicitor.

(3) Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be routed to the inbox of the applicant solicitor’s Electronic Filing Service account. Where the summons is filed through the service bureau, it may be collected at the service bureau. Enquiries by telephone will not be entertained.

(4) Where a summons is filed in a matter for which a trial or hearing date has already been fixed, the summons must include a special request informing the Court of the trial or hearing date(s).

## 53. Notice of Proceedings

(1) This paragraph applies to all originating applications except originating applications for:

> (a) orders under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014; and
>
> (b) an appeal against the decision of a tribunal, an application for a case to be stated or an application by way of case stated.

(2) An originating application is to be served with the applicable Notice of Proceedings (“NOP”), which sets out important information to the recipient on subsequent steps which he or she should take.

(3) The table below sets out the applicable NOP which should be used depending on the nature of the originating application:

| Nature of application                                                                                                                                                                          | NOP to be used                                                                                              |

(4) While the correct version of the NOP is designed to be issued along with the originating application, the applicants are reminded to verify the accuracy of the information within the NOP. The crucial details include the correct timeline for the recipient’s response and the correct version of the NOP.

_**Generation of NOP**_

(5) For an originating application for orders under the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (Simplified), the NOP (Simplified) can be generated in the iFAMS with the originating application when the originating application is issued. Otherwise, the applicant shall prepare the NOP using the relevant URL link in the iFAMS or the relevant forms in these Practice Directions.

(6) For all other originating applications to which this paragraph applies, the NOP can be generated in the IELS in 2 ways: (a) with the originating application when the originating application is issued; or (b) as a separate court document.

(2) Where the child has been issued a digital or electronic birth certificate, sub-paragraph (1) does not apply. To avoid doubt, where the child has been issued a digital or electronic birth certificate that cannot be verified (e.g. by way of a QR code), the Court may direct the applicants to furnish evidence in support of the authenticity of the child’s birth certificate.

## 4C: Proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act 2008

## 58. Where permission is required to make an application

Where permission is required to make an application, that prayer must be included in the main application itself. There is no requirement for a separate application for permission. The grounds upon which the applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated clearly in the supporting affidavit.
